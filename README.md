# CHATROOM APPLICATION
## INTRODUCTION  
For this project, I followed a tutorial to build a real-time chat application using React and Socket IO. I learned about React State Hooks, an alternative way to pass props, and event handling-- for both UI components and socket events. It was quite interesting to preview and implement event creation and event handling. It's something I learned when creating events in Unity, many months ago, and the concept finally makes sense now.

Also, while I cannot claim to have built the back-end myself, I can claim I built the front-end by myself. Moving forward, I am going to use the general principles I learned from this project to build MataChat and ChitChat (both of which are senior projects).

## TECHNOLOGY USED
CORS  
React
